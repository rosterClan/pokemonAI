## About The Project 
A mobile application designed to engage users in environmental conservation by gamifying plant species identification. Inspired by Pokémon, users capture images of flora, which are analyzed via AI (PlantNet API) to identify species. The app generates Pokémon-style entries using Google Gemini AI and OpenAI DALL·E, turning real-world plants into collectible digital creatures. Features include a personal ‘Dex,’ leaderboards, and a map view using Google Maps API. Built with a Spring Boot backend and AI integration, the project enhances public participation in biodiversity tracking through gamification.

## Clarifications
This was a group project between myself and five other student developers. Much of the java backend wasn't developed by me. However, I was practically SOLY responceible for the entire backend. This includes creating the initial wireframes, mockups and pracitcal implementation.

## How to setup
Because I didn't work on the backend I'm not entirely sure how to get the entire project running, dispite including all the backend files. If you want to see some of my backend skills you can view my Arbitrage Odds Scraper. However, if you navigate to the frontend folder you'll be able to run my react application. Granted, you won't be able to get past the login screen.
