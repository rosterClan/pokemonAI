## About The Project 
This mobile application is designed to engage users in environmental conservation by gamifying plant species identification. Inspired by Pokémon, users capture images of flora, which are analyzed via AI (PlantNet API) to identify species. The app generates Pokémon-style entries using Google Gemini AI and OpenAI DALL·E, turning real-world plants into collectible digital creatures. Features include a personal ‘Dex,’ leaderboards, and a map view using Google Maps API. Built with a Spring Boot backend and AI integration, the project enhances public participation in biodiversity tracking through gamification.

## Clarifications
This was a group project involving myself and five other student developers. While much of the Java backend wasn't developed by me, I was primarily responsible for the entire backend. This includes creating the initial wireframes, mockups, and practical implementation.

## How to Set Up
Since I didn't work on the backend, I'm not entirely sure how to get the entire project running, despite including all the backend files. If you want to see some of my backend skills, you can view my Arbitrage Odds Scraper. However, if you navigate to the frontend folder, you'll be able to run my React application. Note that you won't be able to get past the login screen.
